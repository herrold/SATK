                      SATK - Stand-alone Tool Kit
              
SATK is intended to assist in the development of stand-alone, or baremetal, programs 
on mainframe compatible systems using the GNU assembler, as.  While targeting the 
Hercules emulator, nothing precludes its use with "big-iron" real or virtual 
environments.
