                      SATK - Stand-alone Tool Kit
              
SATK is intended to assist in the development of stand-alone, or baremetal, programs 
on mainframe compatible systems using the GNU assembler, as.  While targeting the 
Hercules emulator, nothing precludes its use with "big-iron" real or virtual 
environments.

The following directories are provided:
    doc             - various related documentation
    doc/iplelf      - Documentation related to the IPL ELF Supplement and SATK 
                      support.
    hstage0         - an architecture and media agnostic stage0 boot loader.  The 
                      'h' stands for the Hercules environment that supports the 
                      loader or the host file system from which it loads content.
    lib             - Linker scripts
    mlfloadr        - Stage0 loader utilizing VM emulated block I/O for program 
                      loading.
    mlfutil         - Utility to build an OpenSolaris s390x FBA IPL Disk using 
                      mlfloadr
    src             - source code for use in stand-alone programs.
    src/ipl         - IPL ELF supporting source
    src/ipl/include - Routines useful for IPL ELF stage0 loaders.
    test            - tests for the IPL ELF Supplement support.
    tools           - Python and bash tools for use with SATK.
    tools/ipl       - IPL ELF Media Preparation Processor, iplmed.py, and related 
                      tools: ipldpp.py, media.py
